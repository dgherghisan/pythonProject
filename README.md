This web app is created for test.

A CRUD web app for products.

I didn't add the Dockerfile and docker-compose for now but if is needed I will do it with pleasure.

To launch the app please use: python manage.py runserver on  http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
Just for visualisation I created the view_product endpoint. 

Also I keep the .env file visible on repo just for you to have access to secret key.
